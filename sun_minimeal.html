                Designing the MINIMEALS app posed several unique challenges.
                Firstly, crafting an engaging user experience that encourages
                customers to prioritize better health and set achievable goals
                for increasing their Sun Scores required thoughtful interface
                and gamification elements. Secondly, showcasing the product
                comprehensively across various app sections while maintaining
                clarity and nutritional detail was a design balancing act.
                Lastly, presenting detailed nutritional charts in a visually
                appealing and easy-to-understand manner demanded creative
                solutions to ensure user comprehension and engagement with the
                product's benefits.

              Our main priority was to translate the re-branding into a ready to
              use digital design system. Our vision was to have a consistent
              brand experience on all Randstad digital touchpoints. Our mission
              was to enable teams to create digital products better, faster and
              more cost efficiently. We did this by giving access to a single
              source of truth in design & code for external & internal facing
              applications.
