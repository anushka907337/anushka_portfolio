            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
              In today’s fast-paced world, acquiring new skills often requires
              significant financial investment or navigating overwhelming online
              resources. Many individuals possess valuable skills they’re
              willing to share but lack a platform to do so effectively. Learn
              Loop addresses this gap by creating a user-friendly space for
              skill exchange.

            <p>
              The success of a Learn Loop will depend on its ability to address
              the user’s core needs: flexibility, community engagement,
              recognition and personalized learning. Features that reduce time
              commitment, facilitate easy matchmaking, and offer both
              asynchronous and synchronous learning will drive adoption. The app
              should also cultivate a supportive environment to overcome
              barriers like fear of judgment and help users build trust.
