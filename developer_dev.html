            I was the lead designer of Developers.dev (website) with one of the
            Senior Designer. We made the website look better with a new design
            style that matched the company's global image. As a result, we could
            make the front-end part of the website 60% faster. Plus, everything
            on the website now looks the same and works well.

            <h2>The business challenge</h2>
            <p>
              As a outsourcing company based in India face several significant
              challenges. These firms need to acquire clients and projects from
              overseas, which can be highly competitive. Converting potential
              clients is a hurdle due to the abundance of skilled developers in
              India. Overcoming stereotypes about outsourcing quality and
              ensuring data security are also key concerns. These companies must
              adapt to market trends and cultural differences while striving to
              maintain high-quality work and attract and retain top talent in a
              dynamic and evolving industry

              To address these challenges, we should focus on specialized
              expertise to stand out. Building a strong online presence and
              showcasing a robust portfolio can help in client acquisition and
              conversion. also offer competitive pricing models without
              compromising quality to win projects from overseas clients.

              After the first workshop I took the mission statement and the

              It was decided to go with the second approach because, due to the
              simplified Colorful style, they felt that it gives them more
              freedom to emphasize the photography of various events.
